#  Interactive Particle System with p5.js

This project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, enhanced by the powerful **p5.js** library to create an interactive animated particle system. The particles 
dynamically respond to cursor movement, offering an immersive and modern visual experience.

To activate the interaction, users can **right-click** on desktop or **tap and hold** on mobile devices. Once activated, simply move the cursor or finger across the screen to 
see the particles in motion.
